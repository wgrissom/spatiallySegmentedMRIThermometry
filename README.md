# spatiallySegmentedMRIThermometry
This repository contains code and data from the manuscript 'Spatially-segmented undersampled MRI temperature reconstruction for transcranial MR-guided focused ultrasound', by Gaur, Werner, Feng, Fielden, Meyer, and Grissom. Submitted to Journal of Therapeutic Ultrasound in December 2016. 

Running the reconstruction requires Jeff Fessler's toolbox, which can be obtained [here](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/index.html)
